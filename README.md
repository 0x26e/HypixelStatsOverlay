Welcome to a a functioning but not really nice looking stats overlay that I made
I have no idea how github works so if I messed anything up dm me on discord Zeerk#7777

First thing you need to do is install the latest version of python3

**IMPORTANT**
AT THE END OF THE PYTHON INSTALLATION MAKE SURE TO CHECK OFF THE BOX THAT SAYS "ADD PYTHON TO PATH"

https://www.python.org/downloads/



You also need 2 modules that I use in python for this,
Requests (to grab the info from the hypixel api) 
Tkinter(the gui that the overlay is running on)

I made it stupid easy to install, you can either run '[RUN FIRST] install modules.bat'
Or if you want to do it yourself:
	-open a command prompt
	-type pip install requests
	-when its finished type pip install python-tk

After this you are going to need to get your api key and uuid and paste it at the
top of the code.

To do this, right click the python file (Hypixel Stats Overlay vX.X.X.py) and open with notepad
You will see instructions how to get your api key and uuid and where to put them at the top

If you have any questions, suggestions, or wanna give me a hand making this look nice :3
